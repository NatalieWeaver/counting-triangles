# The Infamous Triangle-Counting Problem

The TeX documents in this repository provide various solutions and visualizations to the triangle-counting problem from the Eugene Math Circle, Elementary I and II, Fall 2019.
* To count all triangles in a 3 by 3 triangle by size, see the **By Size** directory.
* To count all triangles in an arbitrary *n* by *m* triangle using the inclusion-exclusion principle, see the **Inclusion-Exclusion** directory. This directory also contains some example videos and gifs for example values of *n* and *m*.
* To count all triangles in an arbitrary *n* by *m* triangle by assigning triangles to mutually exclusive categories, see the **Sean's Version** directory. This method was adapted from my inclusion-exclusion code by my friend Sean Ericson.

Stay tuned for possibly even more methods for counting triangles, or possibly other shapes, in the future!
